# midi_extract

Converts midi files to a text file with the midi data in a c-array.
This can be used to integrate in an embedded system to feed e.g., a motor with a sine generator

requirements to midi files:
- only one channel supported
- only one note at a time

In case your base is a more complex midi file you need to adapt it in a DAW before using midi_extract. If your midi file does not match the requirement the according timestamps will show up in the log file.

My favorite DAW is [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), but you might also find some freeware like [Audiacity](https://www.audacity.de/).
